Hello Everyone,

Hope you are all well, we're releasing a new update which introduces account linking between Discord, Minecraft and the Website, some modification to configuration and some bug fixes.

## Features
* [Player Profiles](/docs/products/zander/features/profiles) - Players can now link their Minecraft accounts with Discord and can sign in to customise and style their own player profile.

## Patch Notes

### `config.json`
* A new `googleTag` field to utilise Google Analytics.

### Permissions
* Added `zander.web.punishments` for viewing player and Network punishments for an upcoming update.
* Added `zander.web.audit` for viewing player and audit log on profile.

### Hub
> No changes added in this update.

### Proxy
> No changes added in this update.

### Auth
* Added `zander-auth` module JAR for backend Minecraft-based authentication.

### Web
* Added player profiles and profile editor.
  * Allows the user to add social media, about page, interests and more.
* Implemented Discord-based authentication gateway.
* Implement Google Analytics tags and config.

#### API
* Implemented Discord-based authentication gateway.

> Have a look at our API documentation for information on routes functionality.

#### Discord
* Implemented the following commands:
  * `apply` - A simple application command to direct users to the application page.
  * `poll` - Command in the previous update, ported and updated for this suite.
* Removed the following commands:
  * `legoflip` - due to the proxying of Minecraft images via Craftatar this killed all requests via discord making this command useless (Removed all Craftatar discord side features due to traffic amplification attacks.)
