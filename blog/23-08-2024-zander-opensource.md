We're excited to announce that Zander, our flagship project at Modular Software, is now officially open source!

# What is Zander?
For those unfamiliar, Zander is a powerful web-based application that operates and connects between Minecraft, Discord and it's own web-based platform and API. This project is mainly being used by our group over at [Crafting For Christ](https://craftingforchrist.net). Zander is the backbone for and main operation system for this server.

# Why Open Source?
Open-sourcing Zander is a move that reflects our commitment to transparency, collaboration, and innovation. By making the source code available to the public, we aim to:

* **Foster Collaboration:** We believe that the best ideas come from diverse perspectives. By opening up Zander, we're inviting developers from around the world to contribute, share ideas, and help shape the future of the project.
* **Accelerate Development:** With the community's involvement, we can identify and fix bugs faster, implement new features, and continuously improve the framework. Your contributions can make a real impact on the speed and direction of Zander's evolution.
* **Support Learning and Growth:** Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting out, contributing to an open-source project like Zander is a fantastic way to learn, grow, and showcase your skills. You'll have the opportunity to work alongside experienced developers and gain insights into best practices in modern web development.
