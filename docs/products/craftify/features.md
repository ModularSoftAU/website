## Loot Tables
* End crystals are obtainable through End-City loot chests.
* When a player is killed by another player, their head will be dropped as a loot item.
* When defeated, the Ender Dragon will drop an egg as an item.

## Warp
The Wild warp system is a unique feature in many online games that allows players to be randomly teleported to a new location from their original spawn point. 
This feature is particularly useful in games with large maps or those that require exploration, as it allows players to discover new areas without having to travel long distances on foot. 

In addition to the Wild warp system, this offers targeted warps that allow players to travel to pre-set locations. Targeted warps include 3 named points (Spawn, Shop, Community), 16 coloured warps (The minecraft colour set), and 12 numbered warps (1 to 12). All except the numbered warps are created and managed using a command book.

This feature is particularly useful for players who want to quickly travel to specific locations or for those who want to return to areas they have previously explored. Overall, these warp systems offer players greater flexibility and convenience when playing online games.

## Baby Animals
Naming any animal "Forever Young" will prevent it from growing into an adult.
Naming the baby animal "Forever Old" will reverse this effect.
When either name is successfully triggered, the animal will glow for a few seconds and the name will be removed.

## Other Functions
