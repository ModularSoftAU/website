## Installing on Singleplayer
* Select the world you want to install the data pack for, click on "Edit", then "Open world folder".
* Open the folder named datapacks, and put the data pack into it. It should be a .zip file or directory.
* Type `/reload` (if you have enabled cheats) or press F3 + T if you are in the world during the installation.
* If the data pack has a correct format, it would be enabled in the world. 
  * If you have enabled cheats, you can verify by typing `/datapack list` enabled and find an entry named [file/your data pack file/directory name].
  * If it doesn't work then reload minecraft.

## Installing on a Server
* Download the data pack. It should be a .zip file or directory.
* Open your server folder, then open the folder of the world you wish to install the data pack in (default: world).
* Put the data pack into a folder named datapacks.
* Type `/reload` from the console or as a level 3 operator if the server was running during the installation.
* If the data pack has a correct format, it would be enabled on the server. You can verify by typing `/datapack list` enabled from the console or as a level 3 operator and find an entry named [file/your data pack file/directory name].
