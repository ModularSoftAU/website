## Warp
The Wild warp system is a unique feature in many online games that allows players to be randomly teleported to a new location from their original spawn point. 

This feature is particularly useful in games with large maps or those that require exploration, as it allows players to discover new areas without having to travel long distances on foot. In addition to the Wild warp system, this offers targeted warps that allow players to choose from up to six pre-set locations.

This feature is particularly useful for players who want to quickly travel to specific locations or for those who want to return to areas they have previously explored. Overall, these warp systems offer players greater flexibility and convenience when playing online games.
